### Free Code Camp Tribute Site

I chose Mae Jemison, the first African-American woman in space to be the focus of my tribut project.
I really tried to keep it close to the sample and I really didn't belive I could use almost NO 
CSS for this page. As I coded along, and reviewed the bootstrap documentaion, it was really easy.
